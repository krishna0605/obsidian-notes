point ============================
println("Hey,I am Krishna! A logical enthusiast about finding solutions");
I am part of a humble community called EIPG - Engineering innovation projects group. I initiated this community a year ago. 

1) my community is a space where everyone can share their ideas openly and collaborate to develop them further.
2)  One instance is we use techstack to connect likeminded individuals working on similar ideas, so they can take their project up a notch.
3)  I as an initiator build network and get more industry experts involved in my community so that we all can learn together and create. In the past year we have organized a few expert hands on sessions 
4) As we have achieved a few collaborative session with few industrial expert such session were focused on the experience and practical knowledge that they achieved what kind of mistake the expert made when there were in there learning stage 








the 
we are a very small community which is based on  aspiring student who build new innovative projects which can contribute to solve a problem  we are mainly focused on helping students understands entrepreneurship and our alumni and the faculties help the student improve there projects
