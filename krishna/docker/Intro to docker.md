it is an exe  file how to make container 

**port mapping**
is when the mapping of local host port is mapped in the virtual environment and when you run it in the local environment  it doesnt work 


use this command 
docker run -it -p port number:port number name of image  
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 openweb oi
