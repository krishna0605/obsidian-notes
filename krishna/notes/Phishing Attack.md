What is Phishing Attack  

1) A phishing attack is a type of cyber attack where an attacker sends a fraudulent message or communication, typically via email or instant messaging, with the intent of tricking the recipient into divulging sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or other personal or financial information.

2) The fraudulent message may appear to come from a trusted source, such as a bank or other financial institution, or a well-known company or brand. The message may also include a link that, when clicked, leads the recipient to a fake website that is designed to look like the legitimate site but is actually controlled by the attacker. 

3) Phishing attacks can also involve the use of phone calls or text messages, and may be used in combination with other social engineering tactics to increase the likelihood of success. The goal of a phishing attack is usually to gain access to sensitive information that can be used for financial gain, identity theft, or other malicious purposes.


# Example Of Phishing Attack

▶  Let's say you receive an email that appears to be from your bank, and the email includes  the bank's logo and a message that says there has been suspicious activity on your  account. The email urges you to click on a link and log in to your account to review the  activity and take action.

▶  When you click on the link, it takes you to a webpage that looks exactly like your bank's  website, and prompts you to enter your login credentials. However, this website is  actually controlled by the attacker, who is collecting your login information as you enter  it. Once the attacker has your login credentials, they can access your bank account and  make unauthorized transactions or steal your money.

▶ In this example, the attacker is using a phishing email to trick you into revealing your  login credentials and other sensitive information. It's important to be cautious when  receiving emails like this, and to always verify the sender and the authenticity of the  message before taking any action or clicking on any links.

# Types Of Phishing Attack

1.Email phishing: This is the most common type of phishing attack, where the attacker  sends a fraudulent email that appears to be from a legitimate source. The email may  contain a link to a fake website or an attachment that, when opened, installs malware on  the victim's device.

2.Spear phishing: This is a targeted form of phishing, where the attacker researches the  victim and creates a personalized message that appears to be from a trusted source. The  message may contain information that is specific to the victim, making it more  convincing.

3.Whaling: This is a type of spear phishing that targets high-level executives or individuals  in positions of power. The attacker may impersonate a CEO or other executive and send a  message that appears to be urgent or confidential, in an attempt to get the victim to  divulge sensitive information.

4.Smishing: This is a form of phishing that uses SMS text messages instead of email. The  attacker sends a text message that appears to be from a legitimate source, and may  include a link or prompt the recipient to reply with sensitive information.

5.Vishing: This is a type of phishing that uses voice calls instead of email or text messages.  The attacker may impersonate a representative from a trusted organization and use  social engineering tactics to convince the victim to divulge sensitive information over the  phone.

6.Clone phishing: This is a type of phishing that involves creating a fake copy of a legitimate  email or message, with minor changes that make it appear to be a resend or update. The  recipient may be tricked into thinking the email is legitimate and may follow the  instructions in it, leading to the theft of sensitive information.

# How To Mitigate Phishing Attack
▶  Educate yourself: Learn about the different types of phishing attacks and how to recognize  them. Be aware of the warning signs of a phishing email, such as suspicious links or  attachments, spelling and grammar errors, or requests for personal information.

▶ Be cautious: Don't click on links or download attachments from emails or messages that you're  not expecting or that seem suspicious. If you're not sure about an email's authenticity, contact  the sender directly to verify it.

▶  Use anti-phishing software: Install anti-phishing software on your computer and keep it  updated. This can help to identify and block phishing emails and other fraudulent messages.

▶  Keep software up-to-date: Keep your operating system and software updated with the latest  security patches and upgrades. This can help to prevent known vulnerabilities from being  exploited by attackers.

▶  Use strong passwords: Use strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts, and  consider using a password manager to help you remember them.

▶  Enable two-factor authentication: Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever  possible, which provides an additional layer of security by requiring a second form of  verification, such as a code sent to your phone.

▶  Report suspicious messages: If you receive a suspicious message or email, report it to the  appropriate authorities, such as your IT department or the organization being  impersonated. This can help to prevent others from falling victim to the same attack.
