println("Hey,I am Krishna! A logical enthusiast about finding solutions");
I am part of a humble community called EIPG - Engineering innovation projects group. I initiated this community a year ago on the Engineers day on 15 September under the guidance of dean & HOD of School of engineering Dr Vishvjit Thakar

Our community is a vibrant space where ideas flow freely and collaboration thrives. We've cultivated an environment that encourages every member to share their thoughts openly, fostering innovation and mutual growth. This open exchange of ideas allows concepts to evolve through collective input and refinement.

We leverage technology to connect individuals with similar interests and complementary skills. This targeted approach enables members to find collaborators easily, elevating their work to new heights. By connecting like-minded individuals

As an initiator, I actively expand our network and enrich our collective knowledge base by engaging industry experts. Over the past year, we've organized hands-on sessions led by these professionals, bridging the gap between theory and practice.

These collaborative sessions have been particularly impactful, focusing on real-world experiences and practical knowledge. Experts candidly discuss mistakes and challenges from their learning stages, providing invaluable guidance on navigating professional growth and project development. This approach accelerates our members' development, equipping them with insights typically gained only through years of experience.
